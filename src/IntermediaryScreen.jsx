    <p>
      The chinese lunisolar calendar (黄历) is a traditional time-tracking
      system meant to be useful to villagers and farmers for agricultural and
      cultural purposes. The history of the calendar is vast and complex (and
      spans different cultural contexts), but at its core it is a lunisolar
      calendar that tracks both the cycles of the moon and the sun. The calendar
      is divided into 24 solar terms (节气), each marking a specific
      astronomical event or natural phenomenon throughout the year. These solar
      terms can be further divided into three seasons (候), each lasting about
      five days, which often reflect a particular aspect of nature or change
      during that period. The Infinite Almanac is inspired by this traditional
      system and expands the 72 lines to a full calendar cycle of 365 days.
      Written in a style inspired by the renga, each line corresponds to a day
      of the year and reflects the changing seasons, natural phenomena, and
      cultural events associated with that day, and is intended to be read in
      any order throughout the year.
